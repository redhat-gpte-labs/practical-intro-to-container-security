Container images can easily be pulled from any public registry and run on a container host but is this good practice? Can you trust this image and what are its contents? A better practice would be to inspect the image before running it. 

=== Podman inspect

.Use `podman` to inspect the %RHEL_CONTAINER% image. Remember, this image must be present in local storage. Examine the output to determine who is the maintainer and what is the version of that image?

$ *podman inspect %RHEL_CONTAINER%*

=== Podman diff

.The `podman diff` command can help understand the difference between a container image and it's parent

$ *podman diff --format=json %RHEL_CONTAINER%*

=== Podman live mounts

Next we'll use the podman command to inspect a container's filesystem by mounting it to the host.

.First, launch a long running container in the background

----
$ *sudo podman run -d --name sleepy %RHEL_CONTAINER% sleep 9999*
----

----

.Next, enter the container's namespace, create some data then `exit` back to the host
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo podman exec -it sleepy bash*

%CONTAINER_PROMPT% date >> /tmp/date.txt
%CONTAINER_PROMPT% exit
----
--

.Next, mount the container. The host mount point should get displayed
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo podman mount sleepy*
----
----
/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/<container-id>/merged
----
--

.Using the `find` command, confirm the `date.txt` file exists in the mounted file system
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo find /var/lib/containers -name date.txt* 
----
----
/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/<container-id>/diff/tmp/date.txt
/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/<container-id>/merged/tmp/date.txt

Security challenge

.How might you search this container's file system for all programs that are owned by root and have the SETUID bit set?
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo find /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/<container-id>/merged -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;*
----

.Un-mount the container when you're finished
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo podman umount sleepy*
----
----
<container-id>
----
--

.Stop and remove the running container
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]

$ *sudo podman stop sleepy*
$ *sudo podman rm sleepy*

=== Working with Skopeo

Skopeo is an additional low level tool that can perform image operations on local or remote images. Give the examples below a try.  

==== Inspecting images

Try the following `skopeo` commands to inspect images from a remote registry. How
many layers does the `ubi` image contain? 

.Try to inspect an image in local container storage. What command did you use?
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *skopeo inspect docker://%RHEL_CONTAINER%*
----
----
{
    "Name": "%RHEL_CONTAINER%",
    "Digest": "sha256:1f0e6e1f451ff020b3b44c1c4c34d85db5ffa0fc1bb0490d6a32957a7a06b67f"
,
    "RepoTags": [
        "8.1",
        ...
        ...
        ...

}
----
--

.Skopeo can also copy images between two registries. See the `skopeo(1)` man page for details and give it a try. An example is shown below. To make this work, the proper image tags must exist and authentication to registries must be in place

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *skopeo copy docker://quay.io/bkozdemb/hello docker://node1.{GUID}.internal:5000/mynamespace/hello*
